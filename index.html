                <p>Openness, accountability, and honesty define government transparency. In a free society,
                    transparency is government's obligation to share information with citizens. It is at the
                    heart of how citizens hold their public officials accountable. Here at TGIF we believe
                    that government should be transparent.<br><br> Governments exist to serve the people.
                    Information on how officials conduct the public
                    business and spend taxpayer money must be readily available and easily understood. This
                    transparency allows good and just overnance. Transparency promotes accountability and
                    provides information for citizens about what their Government is doing.<br><br>We also
                    believe
                    that government should be participatory. Public engagement enhances the
                    Government's effectiveness and improves the quality of its decisions. Knowledge is widely
                    dispersed in society, and public officials benefit from having access to that dispersed
                    knowledge. We invite you to use our site to become actively engaged in American
                    government.<br><br>TGIF works to disclose information in forms that the public can readily
                    find
                    and use. We
                    solicit public feedback to identify information of greatest use to the public.</p>

                            <p class="text-justify">
                                In the West, the idea that government should be open to public
                                scrutiny and susceptible
                                to
                                public
                                opinion
                                dates back at least to the time of the Enlightenment, when many philosophes made an
                                attack
                                on
                                absolutist
                                doctrine of state secrecy, a core part of their ntellectual project. The passage of
                                formal
                                legislative
                                instruments to this end can also be traced to this time with Sweden, for example, (which
                                then
                                included
                                Finland as a Swedish-governed territory) enacting free press legislation as part of its
                                constitution
                                (Freedom of the Press Act, 1766). This approach, and that of the philosophes more
                                broadly,
                                is
                                strongly
                                related to recent historiography on the eighteenth-century public sphere.<br><br>
                                Influenced by Enlightenment thought, the revolutions in America (1776) and France
                                (1789),
                                freedom of
                                the press
                                enshrined provisions and requirements for public budgetary accounting and freedom of the
                                press
                                in
                                constitutional articles. In the nineteenth century, attempts by Metternichean statesmen
                                to
                                row
                                back
                                on
                                these measures were vigorously opposed by a number of eminent liberal politicians and
                                writers,
                                Bentham,
                                Mill and Acton prominent among the latter.<br><br>
                                Open government is widely seen to be a key hallmark of contemporary democratic practice
                                and
                                is
                                often
                                linked to the passing of freedom of information
                                legislation. Scandinavian countries claim to have adopted the first freedom of
                                information
                                legislation, dating the
                                origins of its modern provisions to the eighteenth century and Finland continuing the
                                presumption of
                                openness after gaining independence in 1917, passing its Act on Publicity of Official
                                Documents
                                in
                                1951
                                (superseded by new legislation in 1999). <br><br>
                                The United States passed its Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in 1966, FOIAs, Access to
                                Information
                                Acts (AIAs) or equivalent laws were passed in Denmark and Norway in 1970.
